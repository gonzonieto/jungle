## Functional Requirements

This section lists the functional specs that our mentors will be sampling when evaluating your project submission.

#### Feature: Sold Out Badge

- [ ] Major: When a product has 0 quantity, a sold out badge should be displayed on the product list page
- [ ] Minor: Should ideally be implemented as a question/boolean method in view helper and/or Product model

#### Feature: Admin Categories

- [ ] Major: Admin users can list and create new categories
- [ ] Major: Admins can add new products using the new category
- [ ] Major: Restful routes (`resources`) should be used, and there should be no extra, unused routes exposed
- [ ] Bonus: All admin controllers inherit from `Admin::BaseController` (or similarly named) abstract controller, containing the authentication filter

#### Feature: User Authentication

- [ ] Major: As a Visitor I can go to the registration page from any page in order to create an account
- [ ] Major: As a Visitor I can sign up for a user account with my e-mail, password, first name and last name
- [ ] Major: As a Visitor I can sign in using my e-mail and password
- [ ] Major: As a User I can log out from any page
- [ ] Major: As a User I cannot sign up with an existing e-mail address (uniqueness validation)
- [ ] Major: Passwords are not stored as plain text in the database. Instead, `has_secure_password` is used in the User model, leveraging the `bcrypt` gem

#### Enhancement: Order Details Page

- [ ] Major: The order page contains items, their image, name, description, quantities and line item totals
- [ ] Major: The final amount for the order is displayed
- [ ] Minor: The email that was used to place the order is displayed
- [ ] Minor: As a Visitor I can place an order (i.e. without logging in and therefore without an e-mail address). The original functionality from the inherited code (even though it is not realistic) should therefore not be suppressed.

#### Bug: Missing Admin Security

- [ ] Major: User must enter HTTP auth login/password to access admin functionality
- [ ] Bonus: Should ideally be implemented in an abstract top-level class for admin controllers (e.g., `Admin::BaseController` which the other concrete admin controllers inherit)

#### Bug: Checking Out with Empty Cart

- [ ] Major: When the cart is empty and the user goes to the carts#show page, instead of displaying the contents and a stripe checkout button, display a friendly message about how it is empty and link to the home page

## Git

- [ ] Minor: The git commit history should have multiple commits and reasonable commit messages. There should be good use of branching and merging for each feature.

## Stretch Features

#### Automated Tests

- [ ] The automated tests are not required for the project to be submitted.

#### Feature: Product Rating

- [ ] Major: Use of nested resources in the routing, and not using custom controller actions
- [ ] Major: As a visitor I can view the overall rating of products as I browse the catalog
- [ ] Major: As a visitor I can view the list of ratings and reviews when viewing the product detail
- [ ] Major: As a logged in user I can rate & review a product in a single step
- [ ] Minor: As a logged in user I can delete a rating or review that I previously created

#### Feature: Email Receipt

- [ ] Major: The e-mail content should be (minimally) formatted with HTML
  - [ ] It does not need any layout styling and should be mostly, if not all, text (i.e. make do with `<p>`, `<hr>`, `<h1>`, `<br>` and other simple formatting tags)
  - [ ] Since you don't know their name information, it can just have a generic greeting
- [ ] Major: It should list the total as well as each line item in the order
- [ ] Minor: The Order ID should be in the subject line
